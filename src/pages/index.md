#### Why

{% container "columns" %}

{% item "column" %}

## Gender equality is an issue of international economic and social importance.

We know there is much more we can do to make a difference.

For too long, women alone have led the way advocating for and achieving hard-won improvements when so many men hold the power and influence to help advance this work.

The focus of this Meetup group is on working together to achieve a significant and sustainable improvement in the unacceptably low levels of women in technology and leadership. Advancement rates are low, and the pace of change has been too slow. We are following the not-for-profit Institute, Male Champions of Change Ltd's strategy as an innovative intervention that can help in shifting entrenched gender inequalities. The MCC coalition now encompasses eight groups, amounting to around 130 leaders across Australian sectors and industries.

Like them, we want to be upfront and say that being a Male Champion of Change on gender equality requires genuine commitment â€“ time, investment and innovation. We aim to share with you approaches and resources to help you get started, get momentum and accelerate your impact in your own working environments.

None of us can claim to have everything right. Yet we are resolute that championing change on gender equality cannot wait until we can all claim to be perfect role models.

It starts with those of us who are willing to step up, work together, listen, learn and lead with action.

At each Meetup our members can expect to hear from male leaders in technology who are on the journey too, using their leadership shadows to start the conversation, sharing their experiences and facilitating problem-solving in the tech community. Members can take inspiration and tangible strategies away to use in their own work environments. And they join a like-minded community of people who want to be the change they seek because balanced teams are better for people and better for business.

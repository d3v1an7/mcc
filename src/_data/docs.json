In doing this, we can create an environment condusive to not only attracting and hiring, but also retaining female talent into tech teams. There is a lot of guidance in this kit, however the value for MCC's lies in the ability to get clarity on how your organisation stacks up, it's appetite to address gender diversity where it's needed most (ie. designing and building products and services for all) and what needs to be done to make the change.",

      "description": "The public presence or ‘face’ of organisations must be addressed as part of deeper efforts to identify and improve organisational cultures that may, or may appear to, exclude women. These can be perpetuated and reinforced through the use of outdated stereotypes, language and imagery, unjustified gender imbalances, symbols of success and barriers to entry. The discipline of regularly testing the messages you project draws the eye to a range of improvement opportunities - from small to significant. Taken together, there is considerable organisational, community and commercial upside to capitalise on.

      "description": "INFOGRAPHIC\n\nIn 20018/19 Project F conducted a survey of 1300 women working in technology-specific careers. The intention was to uncover the differences in workplace values and priorities between women in technology careers versus women in other, non-technical vocations. It has been reported (NCWIT) that 56% of women working in technology roles leave technology (more than double the quit rate of men) mid-career due to lack of support from management, lack of ability to advance their career and poor cultural environments. This infers that women working in technology environments experience the world of work differently to women in non-technical environments and we could therefore assume priorities in a workplace will also differ.\n\nThe results do indeed validate the assumptions described above. Our data demonstrates why traditional diversity and inclusion initiatives generally do not impact gender balance in technology teams, even if improvements are achieved in other areas of an organisation.\n\nThe infographic and a summary document can be accessed on the [Project F Website](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.projectf.com.au%2Fresources&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEQc9SUJtBS45wR7L_Rr4QRWdhNLg)"
